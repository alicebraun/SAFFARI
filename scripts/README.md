## This folder includes all essential scripts that are needed to invoke the rules of the different snakemake modules.

- Credits got to Brian Schilder and Brian Fulton-Howard for making the necessary edits to UKBiobank_LD.R.
- Need to run beta testing for credible_sets, binned_loci, merge_loci scripts for the credible_sets Snakemake rule. 
## Careful: these three scripts work independently for now.
